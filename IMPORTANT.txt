To compile the C++ nodes that you wrote you use "scons platofrm=<platform>" on the home dir.

To get the compile_commands.json you use "cmake -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON" on godot-cpp dir.

Also, after making a new node class in C++ to use it on Godot you need to add it to the "register_types.cpp" or something like that.
